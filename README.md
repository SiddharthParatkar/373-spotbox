# 67-373 Spotbox Website

Welcome to the GitHub page of the Spotbox Website, developed by the 67-373 team consisting of Kalen Gressler, Siddharth Paratkar and Max Sobkov at Carnegie Mellon University. 

If you are a student working on the project under direction of Damon Hargraves or Anthony White, make sure to read the READMEs in all directories, as well as follow their instructions in order to properly set up this project. Additionally, there are plenty of comments throughout all files that have important, user-modifiable code. Make sure you read through and understand each comment before working on that piece of code. Good luck!
