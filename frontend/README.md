## React 
React is a popular front-end framework which means it takes something that would be several lines in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Node.js
Node.js or just Node for short is a back-end framework. This is similar to how React is on the front-end, but it handles the back-end routing and database calls.

## MaterialUI 
MaterialUI, now commonly referred to as "MUI" is a REACT framework. This may seem confusing but it further simplifies the front end by pre-creating components that have design (through CSS) already embedded into it. See the documentation [here](https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/)

## Basic Web Technologies
Fundamentally, behind all of the above, there are 3 languages: HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript (No relation to Java in any way that matters). The common analogy used for these is if a website is a sentence, the HTML is the nouns (determining what content is on the website), JavaScript is the verbs (what the HTML/nouns are doing), and CSS is the adjectives (how the nouns are decorated). There are really great resources on the web to get up to speed, we recommend [this one] (https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css)
