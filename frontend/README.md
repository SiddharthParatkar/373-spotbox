## React 
React is a popular front-end framework which means it takes something that would be several lines in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Node.js
Node.js or just Node for short is a back-end framework. This is similar to how React is on the front-end, but it handles the back-end routing and database calls.

## MaterialUI 
MaterialUI, now commonly referred to as "MUI" is a REACT framework. This may seem confusing but it further simplifies the front end by pre-creating components that have design (through CSS) already embedded into it. See the documentation [here](https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/)
